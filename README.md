**PART 1**

Part 1 was rather difficult because there were some issues with the homography explanation and how CImg worked. However, after this was clarified it went rather well.

We did an inverse transformation in this part, using nearest-neighbor to fill in the empty gaps. This was done by rounding floating point x and y values to integers and using the rounded value in transformation.

Billboard transformation points were calculated manually. The billboard transformations worked well, but there were some issues with image distoration when certain images were overlayed on the billboard.

Homographies were calculated via the matrix in the Burger book.
